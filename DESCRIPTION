Title: Graph and Compare Data Sets for Correlational Analysis
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: Rebekah Brouillette <rebekahb@mail.usf.edu> [aut, cre]
Description: This package will take the data from an imported data set of two variables and compare the numbers while making a graph. This package requires that the data sets are stored in columns so that the compiler can sort each variable into separate objects to be observed. It will then conduct a correlational analysis and create a scatterplot of the two variables.
